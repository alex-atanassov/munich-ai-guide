# BMW Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the demo:

- First run `npm install` to install all dependencies in the project.
- Then create a `.env` file to paste your OpenAI API key.
- Run the two following commands:

### `npm run start:backend`

Runs the backend in the development mode on port `:8000`.

The backend will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start:frontend`

Runs the frontend in the development mode on port `:3000`.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
